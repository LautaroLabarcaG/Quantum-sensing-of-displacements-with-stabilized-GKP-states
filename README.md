# Quantum-sensing-of-displacements-with-stabilized-GKP-states
Repository with the codes necessary to reproduce the results of the article "Quantum sensing of displacements with stabilized GKP states" by authors L. Labarca, S. Turcotte, A. Blais, B. Royer.

All necessary functions are written in the python files "sBs.py", "bits.py", "metrology.py", "backaction.py", and their corresponding noise versions. For the plots, the basic function calls are in "plotsmodule.py". The environement requirements are in "used_packages.txt". 

sBs.py: Functions necessary to run sBs

bits.py: Functions to manipulate bitstrings. 

metrology.py: Functions used in metrological analysis. 

backaction.py: Functions used for backaction evading performance analysis. 

The folder figures contains all the data and code to reproduce the figures of the paper. 

The folder noiseless contains the codes for all results in the absence of noise.
